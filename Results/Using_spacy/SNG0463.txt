Can you help me find a restaurant that serves greek food and is expensive?
I apologize but there are no expensive greek restaurants listed, would you like to try a different food type or price range?
Do you have any Indian restaurants?
We have 14 indian restaurants in the expensive category. Do you have any more information to narrow down the search?
I do not. Is there one you can recommend?
I can recommend one for you, but first is there a particular part of town you would like to travel too?
Any part of town is fine, I just need the address and postcode of one you'd recommend.
I would recommend the Maharajah Tandoori Restaurant.  It's in the west end.  The address is 41518 Castle Street City Centre. The postcode is cb30ah. Shall I make a booking?
No, not yet, I just wanted the info.  Thanks.
You're welcome. Have a very nice day.
