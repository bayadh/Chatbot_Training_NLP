 I apologize but there are no expensive [NORP]  restaurants listed , would you like to try a different food type or price range ? Do you have any [NORP]  restaurants ? We have [CARDINAL]  indian restaurants in the expensive category . Do you have any more information to narrow down the search ? We have 14 [NORP]  restaurants in the expensive category . Do you have any more information to narrow down the search ? Any part of town is fine , I just need the address and postcode of [CARDINAL]  you 'd recommend . I would recommend the Maharajah Tandoori Restaurant .   It 's in the west end .   The address is [CARDINAL]  Castle Street City Centre . The postcode is cb30ah . Shall I make a booking ?
